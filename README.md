# To-Do App

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## About the project

This is a challenge from the FrontEnd Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The objective is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
